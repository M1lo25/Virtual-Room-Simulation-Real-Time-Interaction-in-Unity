# Virtual-Room-Simulation-Real-Time-Interaction-in-Unity
---

This project represents the creation of an **interactive 3D environment** based on a real living room, developed as part of the Virtual Reality laboratory. It was modeled in **Blender** starting from a reference photo and later integrated with interactive elements using the **Unity** game engine.

The project includes 3D modeling, realistic texturing, cross-software import, and the programming of dynamic interactions through C# scripts.

## Technologies used

- **Blender** – modeling and texturing  
- **Unity Engine** – import, optimization, and scripting  
- **C#** – scripting for interactive events  
- **GIMP/Photoshop** – texture editing (if applicable)

## Implemented features

### Modeling
- Accurate construction of objects and furniture based on primitive geometries.  
- Proportions and dimensions faithful to the original photo.

### Textures and Materials
- Assignment of custom materials (e.g., black leather for the armchair, pink for the chair).  
- Photorealistic rendering of surfaces.

### Import into Unity
- Export from Blender in compatible format.  
- Preservation of original properties and materials.  
- Scene optimization for smooth performance.

### Animations and Interactivity
- **Lighting:** switching lights on/off via script (switch and keyboard).  
- **Music:** interaction with the speaker using the `G` key.  
- **Doorbell:** sound triggered with the `E` key.
